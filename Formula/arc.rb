# Homebrew formula for Arc — high-performance columnar analytical database.
#
# GENERATED FILE — do not edit by hand. The release workflow
# (.github/workflows/release-build.yml, job `homebrew-formula`) renders this
# template with the real version and arc-darwin-arm64 sha256, then pushes it to
# basekick-labs/homebrew-tap. Edit this template, not the tap copy.
#
# Binary formula: downloads the prebuilt, cosign-signed macOS binary from the
# GitHub release (built on macOS runners; DuckDB is statically linked, so the
# Mach-O depends only on macOS system libraries).
#
# Apple Silicon macOS only. The platform is declared with top-level
# `depends_on :macos` / `depends_on arch: :arm64` (not nested on_macos/on_arm
# blocks) so `brew install`/`brew info` on Linux or Intel macOS fails with a
# clean "requires arm64 / macOS" message instead of the cryptic
# `Error: arc: url is missing` you get when the only url is inside a skipped
# platform block. The release workflow builds no Intel (darwin-amd64) asset.
#
# Install:  brew install basekick-labs/tap/arc

  def install
    # The release asset is the bare arm64 binary; install it as `arc`. Explicit
    # name (not a glob) so a missing/renamed asset fails loud naming the file,
    # rather than Dir[...].first => nil raising a cryptic TypeError.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Arc stores data locally by default under ./data/arc (relative to CWD).
      Start the server:  arc
      Then it listens on http://localhost:8000 (see `arc --help`).

  test do
    # `arc` boots a server rather than offering a --version-only flag, so the
    # smoke test asserts the binary is present and Mach-O executable. A fuller
    # test (boot + /health) would require backgrounding the server.
